### SimpleStorage Smart Contract Project ###

This project demonstrates deploying a simple smart contract, SimpleStorage, using the Foundry toolkit. 
The contract allows storing and retrieving an unsigned integer value on the blockchain. 
The project includes deployment scripts for local testing (Anvil), simulation on Forge, 
and deployment on the Sepolia testnet using Infura and contract verification on Etherscan.

### Features ###

A simple smart contract for storing and retrieving an unsigned integer.
Deployment and testing with Foundry's forge and anvil. 
Deployment on the Sepolia testnet via Infura RPC. Etherscan contract verification.
